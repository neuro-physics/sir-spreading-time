to do list:

? - output the names of nodes that have the greater number of trends (or organize node names by number of trends)
    - is it interesting?

8) plot_sim_data.m must output a txt file in the main output directory stating the plot details, such as the data origin (raw, flip, z-score to controls), the side (group), number of nodes, the sorting of nodes, etc

------------------------------------------------------------------

POSTPONED 5) adjust scatter and spider plots to plot more than two groups (so I can put R and L TLE in the same plot)

POSTPONED 3) I will select some relevant nodes using richclubness and betweenness centrality to analyze their spreading times separately
    (DONE) - verify the rich club definition for different levels of connectivity k (plot curves RC vs k for groups)
    (DONE) - check Seok-Jun paper or original on how to define the rich club region (after which level of k)
    (DONE) - select rich club nodes to reduce the number of comparisons

POSTPONED 6) plot spider figure of sp times from each MTL node inside functional communities and lobes in one panel (one curve for each MTL seed)

------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE TASKS

DONE 1) fix number of panenls in spider, scatter, and z-score matrix/brain plots

DONE 7) adjust color of patients and controls in spider plots to match the scatter plots
    DONE 7.1) adjust color in top panels of surface plots to match scatter and spider plots (top panels will be disregarded)

DONE 4) add asterisk to panels of scatter and spider plots if controls is significantly different than patients

DONE 1) weighted spreading times
    DONE 1.1) implement simulations
    DONE 1.2) adapt parseSpreadingTime.m
    DONE 1.3) adapt processSpreadingTime.m
    DONE 1.4) create plotting functions

DONE 1) run simulations for theta = [0.005, 0.015, 0.02, 0.025]

DONE 2) calculate stddev for communities and lobes in processSpreadingData.m

DONE 1) I will do a sanity check for the z-scoring of my data again, see if everything is done in the correct order
        - verify order of the calculations:
            - parseSpreadingData.m
                1) gather data from directories
                2) delete Z-scored data if any
                3) from the collected data, calculate the flip and z-score to controls data sets
                4) perform necessary calculations (speed-ups and average in and out spreading time) using all data sets
                5) z-score to controls the last calculations

            - processSpreadingData.m
                1) calculate means for all data sets

DONE 2) I will implement the multivariate analysis of in and out spreading times and plot it on the map (focusing on the whole brain and separately on the MTL)

DONE 2.1) spider plot: plot an area around controls (z=0) corresponding to z_controls + stddev and z_controls - stddev to situate better the patients data

DONE 4) add "plotData" (raw, flip, zScoreToControls) to function plot_sim_data_spider_scatter.m

DONE 7) verify my results with Boris' data (check specifically the weighted short path matrix for each subject, clustering, etc)
Resolution:
Boris calculates the weighted distance matrix based on the inverse FA weights to calculate shortest path that differ between patients and controls
Check e-mail conversation "Analysis" from 16 and 17 of October 2017

    - only 44 subjects are shared between our data
        - 19 Controls: 301_1, 304_1, 306_1, 307_2, 308_1, 313_1, 314_1, 315_1, 317_2, 318_1, 319_1, 320_1, 323_1, 325_1, 327_1, 328_1, 329_1, 333_1, 346_1
        - 13 RTLE: 0369_1, 0380_1, 0384_1, 0393_1, 0394_1, 0405_1, 0419_1, 0436_1, 0444_1, 0449_1, 0454_1, 0458_1, 0474_1 (all HS)
        - 12 LTLE: 0361_1 (HS or Gliosis?), 0364_1, 0370_1, 0392_1, 0396_1, 0403_1, 0415_1, 0421_1, 0422_1, 0428_1, 0437_1, 0460_1 (all HS, except 0361_1 maybe)

    - my data set includes all the patients listed above, PLUS (for Age and Sex Match with my Controls):
        - Controls (n=12): 305_2, 309_1, 316_1, 324_1, 336_1, 337_1, 339_2, 340_2, 341_1, 342_1, 343_2, 345_1
        - RTLE: 0435_1, 0453_1, 0456_1
        - LTLE: 0362_1, 0375_1, 0387_1

    - is 0361_1 HS or Gliosis? -- it is in my data set as HS, but in Boris' as Gliosis
    it is HS (Neda verified it)
